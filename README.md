# Understanding Interactive Media

This seminar course is an introduction to interactive media as part of communication culture. Students critically examine how interactive media (and technology in a broader sense) change conditions of society and culture while being themselves shaped by economic and political forces. The course introduces students to a framework of argumentation and terminology which they will apply to analyze and critique examples of cultural and artistic expression in interactive media. With weekly readings, writing, presentations, discussions, and creative projects, the course lays the conceptual foundation to interactive media practice.

Every week we will look at a different aspect of interactive media. We start by listening to people who were pioneers, activists, artists, exporing that very aspect. We take their thoughts and experience as inspiration to venture off, to make our own sense of what the digital world really is.
For every person featured, we have a video recording of a conversations of approximately 90 minutes. The conversations took place in 2020. All videos are fully transcribed and annotated. Additional readings will be provided.
